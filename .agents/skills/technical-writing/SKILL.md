description: Review technical prose when drafting or changing README files, HexDocs, module docs, npm package docs, usage rules, release notes, comments, commit messages, or delivery summaries. Tie claims to implementation and validation evidence while removing filler. Apply during the writing stage; code-only edits do not need a prose pass.

# Technical writing

Input: the requested draft or changed prose, its audience, and the relevant
implementation, contracts, or validation results.

Output: revised prose in the requested destination, with technical meaning
intact and claims supported by the available evidence.

## Establish the facts

Use the [repository contract](../../../AGENTS.md) for project boundaries and
conventions. Load supporting files only for the claims the prose makes:

- For behavior or API claims, read the owning implementation and relevant tests.
- For compatibility claims, read the [Hex requirements](../../../mix.exs) or
  the applicable manifest in [the npm workspace](../../../npm/) and compare
  them with the runtime or integration actually tested.
- For release claims, read the [release process](../../../RELEASING.md) and the
  relevant package or registry evidence. A local build or tag does not establish
  publication.
- For DocShell renderer claims, read the linked specification and plan in
  AGENTS.md, then compare the claim with the implementation and observed checks.
  A planned item is not evidence of completed work.

Name the package or module that provides the behavior. Distinguish Elixir runtime
behavior from npm behavior, dev supervision from production asset serving, and
generated metadata from host-owned authorization. Frontend qualification does
not establish compatibility for a host's PostgreSQL, Electric, or Phoenix.Sync
deployment.

## Edit and check

Lead with the concrete behavior or outcome. Prefer plain verbs and short examples
that explain installation or ownership. Remove filler, marketing claims, vague
authority, stacked hedges, forced contrasts, and confidence without evidence.
Replace inflated constructions such as "serves as" with "is" when the meaning
is the same. Use formatting to help readers scan.

Compare the revised prose with the input and its evidence. Keep warnings,
failure behavior, compatibility bounds, and ownership explicit. Qualify or
remove unsupported claims instead of widening them. Return unresolved factual
gaps in chat without creating an extra document.
