# PHA.01: DocShell renderers for Svelte and LiveView

Specification version: 0.1.0. Contract: accepted. Implementation status:
partial.

## Purpose

Phoenix Assets provides framework renderers for DocShell's renderer-neutral
artifacts. `@phoenix-assets/doc-shell` is the Svelte renderer. The optional
Elixir integration supplies the equivalent Phoenix function components and a
static HTML renderer for controller, LiveView, and generated-site use.

DocShell owns `doc-shell/v1`, `doc-shell-site/v1`, content projection, route
validation, search records, and renderer conformance fixtures. Phoenix Assets
owns HTML, CSS, browser behavior, Svelte components, HEEx components, and the
adapter code that consumes those contracts. Hosts own routes, authorization,
branding, documentation taxonomy, source selection, and deployment.

## Package boundary

The existing npm package remains:

```text
@phoenix-assets/doc-shell
```

The LiveView renderer belongs to the `phoenix_assets` Hex package under
`PhoenixAssets.DocShell`. It is available only when compatible `doc_shell`,
`phoenix_html`, and `phoenix_live_view` packages are installed. The entire
namespace is conditionally compiled. A consumer that omits those optional
dependencies must compile without warnings and must not resolve frontend-only
dependencies.

No host application name, route, brand, source taxonomy, or authorization rule
may appear under `lib/phoenix_assets/doc_shell/` or `npm/doc-shell/src/`.

## Shared browser core

The npm package exposes a framework-independent browser subpath:

```text
@phoenix-assets/doc-shell/browser
```

It contains:

- safe internal/external URL classification;
- search index loading, ranking, filters, and keyboard state;
- system/light/dark theme selection and persistence;
- mobile navigation and collapsible-group state;
- code-copy controls;
- optional syntax highlighting and Mermaid enhancement;
- tab and disclosure behavior; and
- API request construction and confirmation policy.

The browser subpath must not import Svelte. The Svelte renderer and the
LiveView asset entry both call the same functions. Each function accepts an
explicit root element and can be mounted, refreshed, and destroyed without
global event duplication.

Phoenix Assets also provides an optional Pagefind search adapter and browser
binding. It pins the Pagefind build package, runs it only during asset/site
generation, and records its version and output digests. Pagefind is implemented
in Rust and produces static browser assets; it adds no Python interpreter,
search server, account, or production process. The deterministic JSON adapter
from DocShell remains available for hosts that do not select Pagefind.

Static HTML initializes the browser core on `DOMContentLoaded`. The LiveView
adapter wraps the same initializer in one namespaced hook so DOM patches call
refresh and teardown. Article text, navigation, code source, diagram source,
and API descriptions remain available when JavaScript is absent.

## LiveView component contract

The optional integration exposes these public modules:

```text
PhoenixAssets.DocShell.Components
PhoenixAssets.DocShell.Ast
PhoenixAssets.DocShell.ApiReference
PhoenixAssets.DocShell.StaticRenderer
PhoenixAssets.DocShell.Assets
```

`PhoenixAssets.DocShell.Components` provides documented function components
for:

- complete documentation page and shell;
- header, brand slot, theme and locale controls;
- desktop sidebar, mobile navigation, groups, badges and current-page state;
- search button, dialog and results;
- breadcrumbs, page title, version/status context and announcement banner;
- table of contents and anchored headings;
- previous/next links, last-updated, source and edit links;
- callout, card, link card, card grid, badge, file tree, steps and tabs;
- code block, copy control, plain-code fallback and diagram container;
- backlinks; and
- OpenAPI tags, operation, parameters, request/response examples, recursive
  schema and optional request panel.

Public components declare `attr` and `slot` contracts and have typespecs and
module documentation. They accept `DocShell.Presentation.Site`, `Page`, and
related structs rather than unvalidated maps. Host chrome enters through named
slots and semantic token overrides.

The shell uses scoped CSS custom properties. It does not require Tailwind,
DaisyUI, an icon package, web fonts, a reset stylesheet, or a CDN. Default
icons are local, labelled where interactive, and hidden from assistive
technology where decorative.

## Static renderer

`PhoenixAssets.DocShell.StaticRenderer` implements
`DocShell.Presentation.Renderer`. It invokes the same function components used
inside a LiveView and converts their HTML-safe result to iodata. Its layout
adds the document type, language and direction, metadata, canonical link,
hashed local assets, and an optional base path.

The static renderer does not start an endpoint, supervision tree, PubSub,
LiveView socket, or asset development server. It does not read application
sessions. Host code passes title, brand slots rendered ahead of time, canonical
origin, footer links, and asset manifest as inert values.

LiveView and static output may differ in framework transport attributes. They
must have the same visible content, landmarks, accessible names, heading tree,
routes, navigation order, source links, and page/cohort digests.

## Interaction and layout

The default presentation includes:

- a first-focus skip link;
- a compact header with site identity, search, source link, locale/version and
  theme controls as available;
- a hierarchical left sidebar on wide screens and equivalent modal navigation
  on small screens;
- one readable article column;
- a sticky table of contents on wide screens and an inline disclosure on small
  screens;
- previous/next reading links and page provenance below the article; and
- an explicit 404 page with navigation and search.

At viewport widths where three columns do not fit, the table of contents moves
inline before the sidebar becomes a modal. Content must reflow at 400% zoom and
320 CSS pixels without hiding essential controls. Sidebar width may be user
adjustable, but keyboard resizing and a bounded persisted value are required.

System theme is the default until a reader chooses light or dark. The choice is
applied before first paint when the host permits a local bootstrap script; the
site remains readable if its CSP disallows that optimization. Themes meet WCAG
2.2 AA contrast for text, focus indicators, controls, links, code, and status
badges.

## Search

Both renderers consume the same DocShell search adapter output. The default
dialog opens from a labelled button and the platform shortcut, traps focus,
closes on Escape, supports arrow-key selection and Enter navigation, and
restores focus to its trigger. Results show page, section, collection and
version context. Locale, package, document kind, version, tag and status
filters remain available when present.

The default search path is fully static and sends no query or telemetry to a
service. A host may supply another `DocShell.Presentation.SearchAdapter`, but
the renderer interface and accessibility behavior stay the same.

The Pagefind binding supports section results, locale indexes, and filters for
collection/package, kind, version, tag and status. It lazy-loads index chunks
after search opens. Search HTML and filter metadata come from admitted DocShell
page records; renderer-only chrome and hidden/private content are marked out of
the index.

## Content rendering

`PhoenixAssets.DocShell.Ast` walks only valid DocShell AST. It escapes text,
allows a closed HTML element and attribute set, validates links and media URLs,
and renders unknown directives as visible child content. Heading IDs come from
the projected page; the renderer does not recalculate them.

Code blocks render semantic `<pre><code>` source before enhancement. Copy works
with keyboard and pointer input and reports success without moving focus.
Unsupported languages stay plain text. Mermaid source remains visible in a
fallback block when parsing or browser execution fails.

Tabs use tablist/tab/tabpanel semantics, arrow-key navigation, Home/End, and a
readable stacked fallback without JavaScript. Steps retain ordered-list
semantics. Callout kind is expressed in its text label and not only color.

## OpenAPI boundary

API reference rendering accepts OpenAPI 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 documents already
admitted by DocShell. Schema recursion and references are bounded. Unknown
dialect features remain visible as JSON instead of disappearing.

Request execution is disabled unless the host supplies an exact API origin and
enables it. Paths cannot replace that origin. Cross-origin requests require an
exact allowlist entry and an on-screen destination confirmation. Browser
credentials remain same-origin unless the host explicitly supplies another
credential adapter. Static public documentation must work with the request
panel disabled.

## Visual and functional parity

The Svelte and LiveView renderers consume the same conformance corpus. Parity
means the same user capability and document semantics, not matching component
source or HTML bytes.

The acceptance baseline includes the useful behavior associated with mature
documentation sites:

- clear typography and stable reading measure;
- responsive sidebar/header/table-of-contents composition;
- search available from every page;
- light, dark and system themes;
- localized navigation and right-to-left direction;
- edit/source and last-updated context;
- page status/version badges and release selection;
- heading anchors and reading-flow navigation;
- code highlighting and copy;
- diagrams, content callouts and structured learning components;
- static SEO and machine-readable documentation; and
- no essential feature gated on a hosted service.

## Executable vectors

| ID | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| PHA-V01 | The Hex package compiles with no optional dependencies; installing DocShell plus LiveView exposes every adapter module. |
| PHA-V02 | Importing `@phoenix-assets/doc-shell/browser` resolves no Svelte module and passes DOM lifecycle tests. |
| PHA-V03 | Svelte and LiveView render every DocShell conformance page with equal visible text, headings, links, navigation and accessible names. |
| PHA-V04 | Static and LiveView HEEx output share page/cohort digests and normalized document semantics. |
| PHA-V05 | Keyboard tests cover skip link, search trigger/dialog/results, mobile menu, sidebar groups, tabs, disclosures, copy, theme and locale controls. |
| PHA-V06 | Browser tests cover 320/768/1280 CSS pixel layouts, 400% zoom, reduced motion, light/dark/system themes and left-to-right/right-to-left pages. |
| PHA-V07 | JavaScript-disabled tests retain article, navigation, table of contents, code, diagram source, API reference and all ordinary links. |
| PHA-V08 | Unsafe AST/URL/OpenAPI fixtures are escaped, refused, or visibly degraded according to the closed policy in both renderers. |
| PHA-V09 | JSON and Pagefind search behavior and filters match the fixed corpus in hosted LiveView, static HEEx and Svelte builds; Pagefind loads no index chunk before search use. |
| PHA-V10 | Visual snapshots cover home, guide, module reference, OpenAPI, search, mobile navigation, long code/table and 404 pages in both themes. |
| PHA-V11 | Production assets contain no remote URL, source map, undeclared file, Svelte import in the browser subpath, or file above its declared budget. |
| PHA-V12 | A fresh static-site consumer renders and opens the generated output without an endpoint, WebSocket, Node runtime, or network access. |

## Evidence boundary

Unit and component tests prove renderer source behavior. Playwright tests prove
the tested browser and viewport cohort. Automated accessibility checks support
review but do not claim WCAG certification. Registry publication and adoption
by a host remain separate evidence.
